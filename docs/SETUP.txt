## Welcome!
# How to get started

Install virtualenv / python-virtualenv

In the directory run:

        #virtualenv-2.7 nv      # Setup virtual environment

Your command may look different, but make sure it's using python 2.7.

        #source nv/bin/activate

If you see nv to the left of your username in the terminal, you're good to go.
To leave the virtual environment
        
        #deactivate

Get back into the virtual environment and run

        #pip install -r reqs.txt


Start the server by running:
        
        #python app.py


Open your browser and visit localhost:5000  or 127.0.0.1:5000

# end
